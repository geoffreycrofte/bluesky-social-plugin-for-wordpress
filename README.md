## Shortcode usage

In the shortcodes below, the complete list of attributes is displayed. You can omit them if you want, as the default values or the global values will be used if you omit them.

### Display your profile banner

- `theme`: displays a different set of colors supporting dark and light modes (values: `system`, `light`, `dark`)

### Display the last posts

`[bluesky_last_posts displaysembeds="true" noreplies="true" noreposts="true" theme="system" numberofposts="5"]`

- `displaysembeds`: either you want to display only your posts, or include the embeds too (values: `true`, `false`)
- `noreplies`: either you want to hide your replies, or include them in your feed (values: `true`, `false`)
- `noreposts`: either you want to hide your reposts, or include them in your feed (values: `true`, `false`)
