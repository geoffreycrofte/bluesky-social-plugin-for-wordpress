## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Multi-account as shared (admin) + personal (author) — covers both brand accounts and individual authors
- Decompose monolithic classes before adding features — prevents making tech debt worse
- Async syndication via WP-Cron — prevents blocking post publish UI, handles API failures gracefully
- Feature toggle defaults to false (opt-in for users, protects existing single-account users) — 01-01
- Migration preserves encrypted app_password as-is (no re-encryption) — 01-01
- UUID generation is static method for flexibility — 01-01
- Multi-account section uses progressive disclosure (hidden by default, revealed by toggle) — 01-02
- Status determined by DID presence (authenticated if DID exists) — 01-02
- Authentication test runs immediately after adding account (validates credentials) — 01-02
