  <name>Task 1: E2E verification of Advanced Syndication features</name>
  <what-built>
    Phase 6 Advanced Syndication features:
    1. Editable syndication text per-post with live grapheme-based character counter (300 limit)
    2. Sidebar panel in Gutenberg editor for editing syndication text while writing
    3. Pre-publish panel with same editable text for final confirmation before publish
    4. Category Rules tab in settings with per-account include/exclude category checkboxes
    5. Global syndication pause toggle in settings (Syndication tab)
    6. Custom text used as post body in syndication (both sync and async paths)
    7. Category filtering prevents syndication to accounts whose rules exclude the post's categories
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    **Step 1: Sidebar Panel**
    1. Navigate to Posts > Add New in WordPress admin
    2. In the Gutenberg editor, look for "Bluesky Post Text" panel in the right sidebar (Document settings)
    3. Verify the panel shows a textarea with placeholder "Auto-generated from title and excerpt"
    4. Type some text — verify character counter shows live count (e.g., "15 / 300")
    5. Type or paste emoji (e.g., "Hello 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 world") — verify counter counts family emoji as 1 character (not 11)
    6. Click "Reset to default" — verify textarea clears back to placeholder
    7. Check that panel hides when "Don't syndicate" is enabled on the post

    **Step 2: Pre-Publish Panel**
    1. Click "Publish" to open pre-publish checklist
    2. Verify "Bluesky Post Preview" section shows the same editable text area with character counter
    3. Edit text in pre-publish panel — verify it syncs (same content should appear if you go back to sidebar)
    4. Verify character counter matches sidebar panel behavior

    **Step 3: Settings - Syndication Tab**
    1. Navigate to Settings > Bluesky Social
    2. Verify a "Syndication" tab appears in the navigation
    3. Click on it — verify "Pause all syndication" toggle appears
    4. Check the pause toggle, save settings, reload — verify it stays checked

    **Step 4: Settings - Category Rules**
    1. In the Syndication tab, scroll to Category Rules section
    2. Verify each connected Bluesky account shows with its name/handle
    3. Verify categories appear as checkboxes under Include and Exclude sections
    4. Check some include categories for one account, save
    5. Reload page — verify selections persist
    6. Verify help text explains Include/Exclude/OR logic behavior

    **Step 5: Global Pause (Functional)**
    1. Enable "Pause all syndication" in settings
    2. Create and publish a test post
    3. Verify the post does NOT syndicate to Bluesky (no syndication notice appears, no Bluesky post created)
    4. Disable the pause toggle
    5. Verify new posts CAN syndicate again

    **Step 6: Custom Text in Syndication (if safe to test)**
    1. Create a new post with custom syndication text in the sidebar panel
    2. Publish the post (with syndication enabled)
    3. Check Bluesky — verify the custom text appears as the post body (not the auto-generated title)
